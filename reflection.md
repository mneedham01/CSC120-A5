- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
It was really interesting to see how the different classes interacted with each other and how much power 
they had over each other-- what they were allowed to do. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was easier to plan the first three classes, and then in the Train class, I got confused about the structure 
and the syntax, especially with the "this." I would say to go to TA hours as soon as you start having questions.
